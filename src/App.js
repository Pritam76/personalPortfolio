          Hey, everyone!! This is me, Pritam Mishra, a final year student of
          Electronics and Communication Engineering in National Institute of
          Technology, Trichy. I was born and brought up in Bhubaneswar,Odisha. I
          interned in Wipro Limited in my pre final year summer internship(Jun
          2020 to Jul 2020) which involved around Java and Oracle Database and
          Power BI.
          <br />
          <br />I started with learning{" "}
          <span className="olivecolor">HTML, CSS, JS</span> before jumping into{" "}
          <span className="olivecolor">React JS</span>. I had been parallely
          learning JSP and Servlet technology. I am loving this technology and
          my advancements in this. I would love honing my skills in this domain.
          <br />
          <br />I have referred to{" "}
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" className="redcolor">
            FreeCodeCamp
          </a>{" "}
          and{" "}
          <a href="https://www.w3school.com" className="redcolor">
            w3school
          </a>{" "}
          and have been tryng out different miniprojects for learning these
          skills. I believe these practical skills and mini projects (links
          given below) done by me will benefit me a lot.
